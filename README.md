# Thunderbird-Addon-SearchButton
Extension that implements a button, which when clicked, invokes the message search window (i.e. does the same as clicking the menu commands "Edit" -> "Find" -> "Search Messages")

(Based on a "WebExtension Experiment", compatible with Thunderbird 68. All credits go to darktrojan.)
